            "content":"Starting primary school is a new and exciting journey for every child. It’s also a significant time in their overall development, and good vision forms a crucial part of this. Depending on the country, most children must undergo some form of school entry examination. This “test” usually includes an assessment of the child's visual ability. If any abnormalities are detected during this examination, it is recommended to consult an eyecare practitioner. The specialist will conduct a more thorough examination of the child's eyes and visual ability and may, for example, diagnose nearsightedness (myopia) and decide, together with the parents, whether the child needs visual aids such as glasses.
